                  <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                  <p>Elephants are the large  mammals of the family Elaphantidae, three living 
species are currently recognised. The African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest
elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). They are the only
surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct
relatives include mammoths and mastodons. Distinctive features of elephants
include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like 
legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin.</p> <p>The trunk is prehensile, bringing food
and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the 
incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and 
digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature
as well as in communication. African elephants have larger ears and concave 
backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. </p> 
                   
                         <p>Elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, 
grass, and roots. African elephants mostly browse, while Asian elephants 
mainly graze.[32] They can eat as much as 300 kg (660 lb) of food and drink 
40 L (11 US gal) of water in a day.</p>
